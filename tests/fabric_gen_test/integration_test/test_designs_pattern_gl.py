"""Gate-level (mixed-level) simulation of the demo FABulous user design.

The behavioural fabric wrapper ``eFPGA_top`` (with its configuration
controller) is kept, but the inner fabric core ``eFPGA`` and its tiles are
swapped for the post-place-and-route netlists hardened by the GDS / LibreLane
flow, linked against the PDK standard-cell models. The existing Verilog
``sequential_16bit_en_tb.v`` then drives the mixed-level DUT unchanged — the
exact same testbench the RTL ``run_simulation`` uses.

This mirrors the demo flow in the project ``FABulous.tcl`` (``load_fabric`` →
``run_FABulous_fabric`` → ``gen_user_design_wrapper`` → ``compile_design`` →
``run_simulation``), differing only in the final ``--gl`` step.

Marked ``@pytest.mark.gl`` and skipped from the default suite. Opt in with
``pytest --gl --gl-fabric-project=<path>`` and a Nix toolchain that provides
iverilog plus the PDK cell models (see the GL fixtures in this directory's
:mod:`conftest` for layout expectations).
